          <p style="text-align:justify">Navigating and understanding climate change will become increasingly important to ensuring safe, healthy, and sustainable communities. This map explores pathways for building community resilience to natural
            hazards and climate change by reducing vulnerabilities of people, ecosystems, buildings, and critical infrastructure.</p>
          <p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:.6em;">This map was made by the 2020 NYU Capstone Team (Joseph Baietti, Carrie Eidson, Jah-Milka McClean, David Zhong) for the Belize Association of Planners.</span></p>

          <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City lies entirely at or below sea level, making it vulnerable to storm surge and rising sea levels associated with climate change. The city is expected to see damaging and life-threatening urban floods
            <B><a href="https://thinkhazard.org/en/report/28-belize/UF" target="_blank>">at least once ever 10 years</a></B>. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Most of Belize City is in the 100-year floodplain, meaning there is at least a 1% chance
            that nearly all of the city could be inundated during an extreme hydrological event. However, climate change is making 100-year-floods more common, and there is evidence that "100-year storms" could happen <B><a
                href="https://news.mit.edu/2012/storm-of-the-decade-0213" target="_blank">as often as every 1 to 20 years</B></a>.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Without intervention, flooding in Belize City will become increasingly destructive and severe. However, flooding itself is only one aspect of climate change vulnerability. Because the health and prosperity of
            Belize City and its residents, are so linked to natural environment, climate change impacts can manifest across many different aspects of daily life in the city. </p>
          <p> In the next sections of this map, we will identify areas of vulnerability associated with flooding and climate change, and explain how planning interventions can help to protect people and property, and improve quality of life in Belize
            City.</p>

          <h3>Flood projections for Belize City</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Currently, flooding in Belize City is most severe in the lowest lying parts of the city (Faber's Road, Holy Emmanuel, Orange Street, Queen Street, Hyde's Lane,
            Freetown Road, Belama, and Bellavista), and in the river basin and lagoons that are part of the natural and man-made drainage system. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">However, in more extreme events, such as seen in the 100-years return, storm surge will easily move beyond
            low-lying and coastal areas to overwhelm the inner areas of the city.</p>

      <h2 style="color:#01283c">Sub-standard buildings</h2>
      <p>Vulnerability to climate change, as well as the flooding and severe wind associated with hurricanes and tropical storms, is dramatically increased by low-quality or precarious buildings, particularly when they are concentrated in one area.
        These
        buildings are more likely to collapse or be damaged during storms, increasing the risk of flying debris, injury, and loss of life. </p>
      <h3>About 42% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered low-quality. </h3>
      <p>Buildings are considered low-quality if they lack some basic residential infrastructure, such as running water, electricity, or sewer. These factors can negatively impact residents' health, and can be worsened during severe weather events,
        making it more difficult to shelter in place.
        Low-quality buildings are often made with material such as plywood or metal sheets, which are highly vulnerable to winds and flooding. These buildings are commonly single-family homes concentrated in lower-income areas with unpaved roads
        and on the southwest side of Haulover Creek. </p>

      <h3> About 3% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered precarious.</h3>
      <p> Precarious buildings lack all basic residential infrastructure, and are often built with waste materials and some plywood and metal sheeting to support walls and roofing structures.
        These homes are very unstable and are normally elevated from ground level by pillars.</p>

        <p>As this report from Belize City's News Channel 5 shows, residents of Krooman Lagoon and other flood-prone areas have made many attempts to adapt to the flooding they experience, but greater intervention is needed to protect these

        <h2 style>Environmental degradation</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Mangorve wetlands are one of Belize City's most prized natural resources. The mangroves are a vital part of the ecosystem, and are home to many plant and fish species. Mangroves also serve as storm protection:
          they are
          buffers against wind and waves, and natural flood basins, absorbing water and reducing pressure on stormwater infrastructure. Mangrove forests also protect inland communities and freshwater resources from
          saltwater intrusion.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">However, development in ecologically sensitive areas is reducing Belize City's mangrove wetlands. From 1980 to 2010, Belize City and the nearby cayes <a

          is driven by unplanned development, including informal settlements and suburban commuter towns that are sprawling into wetland areas as the grow. </p>

        <h2>Loss of vibrancy</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City used to be the capital city of Belize and also the hub of economic, political, and cultural development. However, due to severe hurricanes, the Government of Belize moved the capital to Belmopan in
          1970. Following the
          removal of the administration function, the downtown area of Belize City gradually suffered from economic stagnation and urban depression. </p>

        <h3>For the past few decades, Belize City's historic downtown has been less enjoyable for residents and visitors.</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Though once lively and vibrant, the historic downtown now has hardly any nightlife, fewer residents, and very little tourism. As many tourists come to Belize for its lovely natural amenities and beautiful
          offshore islands, they not overly interested in staying in Belize City. Although flights and cruise ships regularly bring visitors to Belize City, most tourists immediately depart for other destinations. Additionally, although many historic
          buildings and
          public spaces remain, there are also signs of blight, and some historic and culturally significant buildings have had to be demolished due to disrepair. </p>

        <p>Belize has a remarkably high homicide rate, much of which is linked to gang violence. As shown on the map, domestic gangs are active in several areas in and around downtown Belize City. The prescence of gangs in the city has
          grown due to factors including the international drug trade, but also local issues, such as <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/belize-city-community-gang-assessment" target="_blank"><B>poverty and a lack of economic
              opportunity</B></a>.</p>

        <p>The violence brought by gangs presents a major challenge to the public safety and economy of Belize City. Violence compromises residents’ quality of life, exposes youth and children to trauma, and results in death or injury for hundreds of
          people annually, disincentivizing tourists to visit. These factors further contribute to the decline of the city center.</p>
