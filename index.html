          <p>Belize City lies entirely at or below sea level, making it vulnerable to storm surge and rising sea levels associated with climate change. The city is expected to see damaging and life-threatening urban floods <B><a
                href="https://thinkhazard.org/en/report/28-belize/UF" target="_blank>">at least once ever 10 years</a></B>. </p>
          <p>Most of Belize City is in the 100-year floodplain, meaning there is at least a 1% chance
            that nearly all of the city could be inundated during an extreme hydrological event. However, climate change is making 100-year-floods more common, and there is evidence that "100-year storms" could happen <B><a
                href="https://news.mit.edu/2012/storm-of-the-decade-0213" target="_blank">as often as every 1 to 20 years</B></a>.</p>
          <P>Without intervention, flooding in Belize City will become increasingly destructive and severe. In the next sections of this map, we will identify areas of vulnerability associated with flooding and climate change, and explain how
            planning interventions can help to protect people and property.</p>

          <h3>Flood projections for Belize City</h3>
          <p>Currently, flooding in Belize City is most severe in the lowest lying parts of the city (Faber's Road, Holy Emmanuel, Orange Street, Queen Street, Hyde's Lane,
            Freetown Road, Belama, and Bellavista), and in the river basin and lagoons that are part of the natural and man-made drainage system. </p>
          <p>However, in more extreme events, such as seen in the 100-year return, storm surge will easily move beyond
            low-lying and coastal areas to overwhelm the inner areas of the city.</p>

      <h2 style="color:#01283c">Sub-standard buildings</h2>
      <p>Vulnerability to climate change, as well as the flooding and severe wind associated with hurricanes and tropical storms, is dramatically increased by low-quality or precarious buildings, particularly when they are concentrated in one area.
        These
        buildings are more likely to collapse or be damaged during storms, increasing the risk of flying debris, injury, and loss of life. </p>

      <h3>About 42% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered low-quality. </h3>
      <p>Buildings are considered low-quality if they lack some basic residential infrastructure, such as running water, electricity, or sewer. These factors can negatively impact residents' health, and can be worsened during severe weather events.
        These buildings are often made with material such as plywood or metal sheets, which are highly vulnerable to winds and flooding. These buildings are commonly single-family homes concentrated in lower-income areas with unpaved roads
        and on the southwest side of Haulover Creek. </p>

      <h3> About 3% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered precarious.</h3>
      <p> Precarious buildings lack all basic residential infrastructure, and are often built with waste materials with some plywood and metal sheeting to support walls and roofing structure.
        These homes are very unstable and are normally elevated from ground level by pillars.</p>

        <h2 style>Protecting environmental resilience</h2>
        <P>Development in ecologically sensitive areas is destroying natural flood protection.</p>

        <p>Both squatter communities and suburban towns are expanding into vulnerable mangrove wetlands. These areas serve as critical buffers against flooding and storm surge during hurricanes and heavy rain. The mangroves are also natural drainage
          basins, helping to ease the strain on strained stormwater infrastructure. As the natural areas are reduced, the city and suburbs become more susceptible to storm damage and flooding. </p>
