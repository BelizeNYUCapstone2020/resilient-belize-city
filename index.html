          <p style="text-align:justify">The impacts of climate change present a growing challenge for communities all across the world. This map explores the climate change vulnerabilities
            facing Belize City, Belize, and suggests possibilities for strengthening ecosystems, buildings, critical infrastructure, and community resilience through careful planning.</p>
          <p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:.6em;line-height:.6em;">This map was made by the 2020 NYU Capstone Team (Joseph Baietti, Carrie Eidson, Jah-Milka McClean, David Zhong) for the Belize Association of Planners.</span></p>

          <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City lies entirely at or below sea level, making it vulnerable to storm surge and rising sea levels associated with climate change. The city is expected to see damaging and life-threatening urban floods
            <B><a href="https://thinkhazard.org/en/report/28-belize/UF" target="_blank>">at least once every 10 years</a></B>. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Most of Belize City is in the 100-year floodplain, meaning there is at least a 1% chance
            that nearly all of the city could be inundated during an extreme hydrological event. Climate change is making such storms more common, and there is evidence that "100-year floods" could happen <B><a
                href="https://news.mit.edu/2012/storm-of-the-decade-0213" target="_blank">as often as every 1 to 20 years</B></a>. Without careful intervention, flooding in Belize City will become increasingly destructive and severe.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">However, flooding itself is only one aspect of climate change vulnerability. Because the health and
            prosperity of
            Belize City and its residents are so linked to the natural environment, climate change impacts can manifest across many different aspects of daily life. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Urban planning helps to identify climate risks and vulnerabilities so that citizens can take informed action to better protect themselves and their city. The Belize Association of Planners is a proactive
            professional planning organization committed to partnering with communities and actors in the urban areas of Belize to build resilience to natural hazards and climate change.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">As we will show in this map, there are many areas where urban planning is needed to address the vulernabilities of Belize City and its residents.</p>

          <h3>Flood projections for Belize City</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Currently, flooding in Belize City is most severe in the lowest lying parts of the city (Faber's Road, Holy Emmanuel, Orange Street, Queen Street, Hyde's Lane,
            Freetown Road, Belama, and Bellavista), and in the river basin and lagoons that are part of the natural and man-made drainage system. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">However, in more extreme events, such as seen in the 100-years return, storm surge will easily move beyond
            low-lying and coastal areas to overwhelm the inner parts of the city.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Water depth on these maps is shown in meters (one meter equals slightly more than 3 feet). As such, projected flood depths will range from .65-.98 feet during lighter events, to
            depths exceeding 13 feet during more intense flooding, as shown on the map in <b><span style="color:#f700f6">bright pink</span></B>.</p>

      <h2 style="color:#01283c">Substandard buildings</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Vulnerability to climate change, as well as the flooding and severe wind associated with hurricanes and tropical storms, is dramatically increased by low-quality or precarious buildings, particularly when they are
        concentrated in one area. These buildings are more likely to collapse or be damaged during storms, increasing the risk of flying debris, injury, and loss of life. </p>
      <h3>About 42% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered low-quality. </h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Buildings are considered low-quality if they lack some basic residential infrastructure, such as running water, electricity, or sewer. These factors can negatively impact residents' health, and can be worsened
        during severe weather events,
        making it more difficult to shelter in place.
        Low-quality buildings are often made with material such as plywood or metal sheets, which are highly vulnerable to winds and flooding. These buildings are commonly single-family homes concentrated in lower-income areas with unpaved roads
        and on the southwest side of Haulover Creek. </p>

      <h3> About 3% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered precarious.</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Precarious buildings lack all basic residential infrastructure. These structures are often built with waste materials and salvaged plywood and metal sheeting to support walls and roofing structures.
        These homes are very unstable and are normally elevated from ground level by pillars.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#01283c">Informal settlements</h2>
        <p>Precarious buildings are commonly found in informal settlement areas—unplanned areas where property rights are unestablished, or land is illegally occupied. Homes in these areas are usually poorly constructed by owners through whatever
          resources they can find. This type of home construction is not suitable for safely weathering natural disasters or flooding.</p>

        <p>In Belize City, informal settlements are found in the lowest areas of the floodplain, making these residents especially vulnerable to climate change impacts. They also face significant socioeconomic challenges, including
          poverty and marginalization. While residents of Belize City's informal settlements are especially affected by climate change, they can also be easily erased from political processes and planning due to factors such as citizenship status or
          lack of property rights.</p>

              courtesy of Belize Association of Planners</i></span>.
        </p>
        <p>Krooman Lagoon and Gungulung, two of Belize City's largest informal settlement areas, are located on ecologically sensitive, flood-prone land. While some residents of these settlements are knowingly squatting, others were given informal
          arrangements to access the land. However, homes constructed on publicly owned land (such as Krooman Lagoon) are considered illegal.
          As such, these residents face a constant displacement threat.</p>

        <p>Residents of these areas face significant public health hazards as well. These communities have no access or unregulated access to electricity, and residents often run a network of informal electrical wires from existing utility lines.
          These live wires are easily blown down during storms or
          times of heavy winds, making electric shock a very real danger if wires may fall into standing water or onto walkways.</p>

        <p>Additionally, informal settlements are not served by sanitation services, and residents often use latrines or toss bagged waste into outside areas. Waste can contaminate the standing water that permeates these communities, which exposes
          residents to dangerous bacteria and diseases. Children are especially at risk for adverse health effects if they walk through or play in water that has been
          contaminated.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Critically, the construction of these informal settlements in ecological sensitive areas also undermines the climate resilience of Belize City. As this Belize Channel 5 story from July 2014 shows, a shortage of affordable housing
          in the city is driving development of Krooman Lagoon, and destroying the mangrove forests of this area in the process. As we'll discuss in more detail in a moment, mangroves serve an important function
          in protecting the city from storm surge and climate change impacts.</p>

        <p>The informal settlements in Krooman Lagoon and Gungulung (shown on the map) are both located in ecologically sensitive areas. Krooman Lagoon is publicly owned land that is designated as an environmentally protected zone. This land is
          highly unsuitable for housing as it is swampy and flood prone. </p>

        <p>As this November 2020 report from Belize City's News Channel 5 shows, residents of Krooman Lagoon and other flood-prone areas have made many attempts to adapt to the flooding they experience, but greater intervention is needed to protect
          these
          communities from flood risk.</p>

          <h2 style>Environmental degradation</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Mangrove wetlands are one of Belize City's most prized natural resources. In addition to being an attractive amenity that draws in international tourists, the mangroves are a vital part of Belize's ecosystem
            and are home to many plant and fish species.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Critically for climate change, mangroves also serve as natural storm protection.
            They are
            buffers against wind and waves, and reduce the force of storm surge before it hits homes and businesses. Mangroves are also flood basins that are capable of large amounts of water, which reduces pressure on manmade stormwater
            infrastructure and enables it to perform better. Mangrove forests also protect inland communities and freshwater resources from
            saltwater intrusion.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
            <h3>However, development in ecologically sensitive areas is reducing Belize City's mangrove wetlands. From 1980 to 2010, Belize City and the nearby cayes <a

          </p>
          <p>The decline of mangroves
            is driven by unplanned development, which includes not only informal settlements such as Krooman Lagoon, but also suburban commuter towns that are growing to the north and west of Belize City. In both cases, the lack of low- and
            middle-income housing is pushing development into
            new areas, including mangrove forests. In addition to reducing the flood resilience of Belize City and the surrounding region, construction in former mangrove areas also exposes those homes to a heightened flood risk.</p>

        <h2>Sprawl and unplanned development</h2>
        <p>The growth of commuter towns and suburbs to the north and west of Belize City is propelling a development push into ecologically sensitive areas. These towns are rapidly gaining population, even as Belize City itself is losing population.
          In 1970, Belize City was home to 78% of the Belize District population, but by 2010, it held only
          60
          percent of the district's population.</p>
        <p> Much of this population movement is related to expense: suitable land within Belize City is scarce, driving up the price. Additionally, low-rise, single-family
          homes are the most common housing type, which limits density and the number of units on the market. Climate change will likely make this worse. As mentioned above, more than 40% of Belize City's housing is low-quality, making it highly
          vulnerable to
          being destroyed in the event of a severe storm. Additionally, competition for the least flood-prone land will likely drive up prices in those areas, potentially displacing lower-income residents.</p>

        <p>People who can't afford to live in the city, yet must commute in for work, are increasingly moving to towns along the north and west highways including Ladyville, Hattieville, Burrell Boom, 8 Miles, and Los Lagos. However, this development
          is proceeding with little consideration of the regional impacts, including destruction of sensitive natural areas and increased car congestion.</p>
        <p>There is no efficient mass transit to connect the commuter towns and Belize City. As such, these commuters largely travel into the city via personal vehicle, creating a spike in congestion and chaotic traffic. This is evidenced by regular
          bottlenecks on the
          highways, particularly at the Haulover Creek crossings. There is an added danger here that, in the event of severe storms, these congested highways (which are themselves flood-prone) also serve as evacuation routes.</p>

        <p>One of the fastest-growing commuter towns is Ladyville, which has a population of about 5,400 in the last (2010) census and is home to the Philip Goldson International Airport. This area is seeing increasingly concentrated industrial,
          office,
          commercial, and airport land use.</p>

          annual growth rate is around 7%, this trend is expected to continue.</h3>
        <p>Ladyville experiences severe flooding and drainage issues. The area is in a natural drainage basin that was once filled with marshlands and mangrove forests. Today the area remains highly susceptible to flooding from heavy rains but is
          increasingly
          losing its
          natural flood protections. Due to its location on the banks of

        <h2>Loss of vibrancy</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The growth of the suburbs is also related to the decline of the center city. Belize City used to be the capital of Belize and also the center of economic, political, and cultural development. However, due to
          severe hurricanes, the capital was moved to Belmopan in 1970. Following the removal of the administration function, the downtown area of Belize City gradually suffered from economic stagnation and urban depression. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">A lack of economic planning in the 1980s further contributed to the decline. Without a variety of businesses in the downtown area, most shops were closed by evening. Downtown became a dead zone that was poorly
          maintained and poorly lit, which attracted nefarious activity. The area soon became associated with Belize City’s high homicide rate. Domestic gangs active in drug trafficking and robberies frequent the area. As the country’s role in the
          international drug trade has grown, Central American gangs and Mexican drug trafficking groups have also established a presence. Many once prosperous neighborhoods have become dangerous even for local citizens.</p>

        <h3>For the past few decades, Belize City's historic downtown has been less enjoyable for residents and visitors.</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Given these factors, the downtown area attracts very little tourism. As many tourists come to Belize for its lovely natural amenities and beautiful offshore islands, they are not overly interested in staying in
          Belize City. Although most flights and cruise ships regularly arrive in Belize City, most tourists immediately depart for other destinations.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Additionally, although many historic buildings remain, downtown also shows signs of blight, and some culturally significant buildings have had to be demolished due to disrepair or damage from natural disasters.
          Public spaces and parks are also used less frequently, and their maintenance is neglected. As a result, residents may feel these areas are unsafe.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">The violence brought by gangs is a major challenge to the economy of Belize City. It compromises residents’ quality of life, exposes youth and children to trauma, and kills or injures hundreds of people annually.
          As shown on the map, many areas frequented by gangs surround downtown Belize City. This creates major incentives for tourists to avoid visiting Belize City.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">While some efforts, including the Downtown Rejuvenation Program of Belize City, are trying to create a better tourism environment, effectively addressing the problem will also require an examination of the

          <p style="text-align:justify">As we've shown, Belize City faces significant climate change challenges. However, they are not insurmountable. Urban planning can help to image what a
            more equitable and resilient Belize City would look like, and create a clear path to achieving that vision.</p>

          <p style="text-align:justify">At present, planning in Belize City is not as strong as it could be. There is limited coordination between the national and local government, and between Belize City and the surrounding
            commuter towns.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> In the next sections
            of the map, we will discuss planning interventions that can help improve quality of life and transform Belize City into a leader in climate resilience. However, it must be emphasized that greater cooperation between the regional
            and national governments, as
            well as broader
            public support for planning efforts, is needed to make this vision a reality.<br><br><br>

          <h3 style="color:#ee8f9a;font-size:1.8em;line-height:1.05em;">Updating and enforcing building standards</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify">National building standards are neither specific nor well enforced. Further, the existing standards are not designed with best practices for climate change and natural disasters in mind, such as considerations
            for the impacts of storm surge, erosion, and flooding.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">An update to Belize's current building standards, as well as improved local enforcement in Belize City is critical. New building codes should consider climate resilient elements, such as elevation of living
            areas and utilities, and more specific material requirements for construction and foundations. These specifications will help protect residents and property from flood waters and other natural hazards. Additionally, <a
              href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/102a/f268ae84059a4421c73fb00b921020fd68d6.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:#d9785d;">coastal setbacks</a> can be used to establish a protective area between housing and the water's edge (or
            sensitive ecological areas, such as mangrove wetlands) to help address coastal erosion. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Updated building standards should be designed in consideration of location and building type. Different standards could be created for existing structures to establish a baseline for safety, with more stringent
            standards applied to new construction. Standards could also be applied differently across locations. For example, there could be higher elevation requirements for structures in the floodplain or <a
              href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1518-20490-3149/04_fema_p550_ch2_rev.pdf" target="_blank">open foundation</a> standards for structures in
            areas with high rates of erosion. </p>
          <p><a href="#" data-featherlight="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/setbacks.png"><img src="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/setbacks.png" style="max-width:90%;"></a><br><span style="font-size:.6em;"><i>Images courtesy Federal Emergency Management Agency. Click to expand.</i></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Improved enforcement of building codes can also help with the upkeep of properties and the monitoring of vacancies, which may help improve public safety and reduce crime. However, it is important that any
            heightened enforcement be paired with educational campaigns and resources to help property owners navigate requirements. These campaigns should be inclusive to residents in low-quality housing, which often includes women-led households,
            migrants, and other minority groups. New and updated building requirements should also be paired with access to capital to make necessary improvements. The government of Belize could establish housing rehabilitation loan and grant
            programs targeted to homeowners and building owners to encourage improvements and incentivize redevelopment. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Improved building codes can also be developed in coordination with land use maps that can restrict new construction in areas of heightened flood vulnerability. </p>

          <h3 style="color:#ee8f9a;font-size:1.8em;line-height:3.9vh;">Addressing congestion and mobility</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify">The congestion along the northern and western highways suggests
            these routes provide sufficient demand for transit lines to connect the commuter towns with the city core. However, comprehensive transit planning is needed to prioritize buses and incentivize commuters not to drive.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Bus and transit reform is also needed within Belize City proper, as routes and schedules are inconsistent. Elderly riders and riders with disability may experience gaps in service as they are not given proper
            time to board the bus or drivers simply do not stop for them.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:.7em;line-height:1.3em;"><img src="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/terminal.png" style="max-width:96%;"><br><i>
              The bus terminal at W Collect Canal as pictured in 2014. (Photos by Jasmine Halki, used under Flickr Creative Commons license.)</i></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Standardizing bus routes, stops, and schedules across private companies would make the system more attractive to residents and visitors. It is especially critical to improve stops and schedules so seniors and
            riders with disabilities have
            more equitable access to the buses. A centralized fare collection system, such as a refillable transit card, would also make it easier for commuters to utilize the system. Incentivizing modernization of the buses, especially in regard to
            accessibility features, would also help
            make the buses more accessible for seniors and riders with diverse abilities. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Additionally, Belize City needs to prioritize adding bike lanes
            and improved pedestrian walkways. To start, the city can emphasize the creation of multimodal corridors throughout the downtown area by adding bike and walking paths that connect to water taxi stations and the bus terminal at West Collect
            Canal.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:.7em;line-height:1.3em;"><img src="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/bikes.png" style="max-width:96%;"><br><i>
              Adding dedicated bike lanes can help to safely separate bike riders and cars. Many streets in Belize City also need sidewalks to separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic. (Left photo from Inter-American Development Bank, right photo
              by Steve Monty. Both used under Flickr Creative Commons License).</i></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Improving mass transit and bike and pedestrian pathways has the added benefit of reducing the number of cars on the roads, which will lower Belize's greenhouse gas emissions. Though Belize contributes less
            than 0.01 percent of the total global emissions, these actions would still help support international mitigation efforts and show Belize to be a leader in climate change planning.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> However, comprehensive transit reform will require extensive coordination and cooperation, not only among the Belize City Council, Ministry of Transport, and the private sector, but also between the Belize
            City Council and the governments
            of the suburban commuter towns. The creation of formal bodies, such as a metropolitan planning commission, can help spearhead these efforts, and work to develop critical guidance, such as a regional master plan.</p>

          <div style="float: right; clear: right;padding-left:3.5vh;padding-bottom:2vh;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oQAsVG_DabI" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" float="right"></iframe>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
            Because Belize City's informal settlements are located in ecologically sensitive areas, these developments threaten the city's broader climate resilience and are unsafe for residents. This is especially true for Krooman Lagoon.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City Council is making efforts to secure land, move the residents of Krooman Lagoon, and restore the mangroves. However, any plan for Krooman Lagoon or other informal settlements must involve a
            consideration of the
            underlying issues of poverty and socioeconomic vulnerability that drove these populations to live in such risky areas in the first place. </p>


          <p style="text-align:justify"> Many residents of informal settlements have jobs that
            are intrinsically tied to the city. They also need to be able to access services in the city, including health care and schools. Moving them could disrupt economic and social networks, and be harmful, if not done carefully. This is
            especially
            critical for women and children.</p>

          <p style="text-align:justify">Around the world, people living in informal settlements are also often
            invisibilized by their government. Commitment to social justice means that it is important
            that any plans for relocation be done transparently, and with the involvement and support of the affected community. Additionally, while City Council works to secure new land, the community's other pressing needs must not go unaddressed.
          </p>
          <div class="video-container2"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FNews5Live%2Fvideos%2F2978090678957841%2F" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><span
            style="text-align:justify;font-size:.7em;line-height:1.3em;display:inline-block;"><i>As this video shows, the walkways of Krooman Lagoon are very vulnerable to flooding.
              One way the city can provide immediate assistance to these residents is by rebuilding these walkways so they are elevated and protected from water.</i></span>

          <p style="text-align:justify">Creating a formal plan for the future of Krooman Lagoon, in partnership with residents, presents one path forward. The plan should involve a phased timeline so the community knows when relocation would happen.
            Additionally, the plan should create a transition team of planning and health care
            professionals to address the community's essential needs both now and after the relocation. This should include preventive care and health screenings, especially for children; job training and employment placement
            assistance; and basic flood defenses while the community remains in the lagoon, including
            regular maintenance of the elevated walkways and materials to fortify homes from water. Many elements of this program could be offered to other informal settlement communities as well. </p>


          <p style="text-align:justify">It is also important to note that commuter towns such as Ladyville are also pushing into ecologically sensitive areas, including mangrove forests. Broader protection of the mangrove areas is another reason why
            comprehensive regional planning for
            the Belize City
            metropolitan region is critically needed.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#ee8f9a;line-height:1.05em;font-size:3.9vh;">Revitalizing downtown</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City has just completed the <a href="https://tourism.gov.bz/hoc-project/" target="_blank" style="color:#d9785d;">The Belize City House of Culture and Downtown Rejuvenation
            Project (BCHCDRP)</a>, a joint project of the Government of Belize and the Taiwan International Development Fund. The project’s goal was to preserve and revitalize historic colonial-style architecture, and introduce amenities to the
          downtown area, including botanical gardens and boardwalks.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The BCHCDRP created an <a href="https://belizecityecomuseum.com/" target="_blank">"EcoMuseum Zone"</a> to guide visitors through historic sites in downtown Belize City. Visitors can download the “Belize City EcoMuseum App” on their mobile devices to get directions to sites
          of interest. Some important historical attractions that have been preserved and revitalized include the colonial Supreme Court, St. John’s Cathedral, and Belize Heritage Plaza.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify"><img src="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/Downtown.png" style="max-width:96%;"><br><span style="font-size:.6em;"><i>(From left) Supreme Court of Belize, St. John’s Cathedral,
              and The Anglican Cathedral College Urban Garden. (Photos courtesy BCHCDRP.)</i></p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">With the EcoMuseum Zone completed, it is important that Belize City Council continue to build on the work of BCHCDRP and make downtown better serve all residents of Belize City. There are many ways planning can
          help with this endeavor.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> For one, refurnishing buildings to add affordable
          apartments over commercial spaces would add desperately needed housing units. These new residents would also serve as a customer base for businesses, and help keep downtown lively at night. Incentivizing a variety of local businesses to
          operate downtown, especially in the evening and at night, is also needed to restore
          vibrancy. Installing more streetlights could also be a simple first step for improving public safety and potentially reducing the occurrence of crime.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> Other new elements could include green amenities and vegetation, and murals or public art that celebrate Belizean culture. Walking and biking pathways could be added to not only improve safety downtown, but also
          to connect the area to transit hubs, such as the bus terminal on W Collect Canal. This will make it easter
          for tourist to discover and explore downtown. All these measures will help bring more business to local shops and restaurants. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">However, if
          downtown is to be revitalized as a hub of new development, long-term
          planning must also consider the effects of climate change.
          Belize City Council should begin planning now to reduce future
          flooding and storm impact on this revitalization project. This will require improved regulatory tools, including comprehensive zoning and a master plan that emphasizes climate resilience.</p>
