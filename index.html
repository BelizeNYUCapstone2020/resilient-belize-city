          <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City lies entirely at or below sea level, making it vulnerable to storm surge and rising sea levels associated with climate change. The city is expected to see damaging and life-threatening urban floods
            <B><a href="https://thinkhazard.org/en/report/28-belize/UF" target="_blank>">at least once every 10 years</a></B>. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Most of Belize City is in the 100-year floodplain, meaning there is at least a 1% chance
            that nearly all of the city could be inundated during an extreme hydrological event. However, climate change is making 100-year-floods more common, and there is evidence that "100-year storms" could happen <B><a

          <p style="text-align:justify">Without intervention, flooding in Belize City will become increasingly destructive and severe. However, flooding itself is only one aspect of climate change vulnerability. Because the health and prosperity of
            Belize City and its residents are so linked to the natural environment, climate change impacts can manifest across many different aspects of daily life in the city. </p>
          <p> In the next sections of this map, we will identify areas of vulnerability associated with climate change and explain how planning interventions can help to protect people and property, build resilience, improve quality of life in

          <h3>Flood projections for Belize City</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Currently, flooding in Belize City is most severe in the lowest lying parts of the city (Faber's Road, Holy Emmanuel, Orange Street, Queen Street, Hyde's Lane,
            Freetown Road, Belama, and Bellavista), and in the river basin and lagoons that are part of the natural and man-made drainage system. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">However, in more extreme events, such as seen in the 100-years return, storm surge will easily move beyond
            low-lying and coastal areas to overwhelm the inner areas of the city.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Water depth on these maps is shown in meters (one meter equals slightly more than 3 feet). As such, projected flood depths will range from .65-.98 feet during lighter events, to
            depths exceeding 13 feet during more intense flooding, as shown on the map in <b><span style="color:#f700f6">bright pink</span></B>.</p>

      <h2 style="color:#01283c">Sub-standard buildings</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Vulnerability to climate change, as well as the flooding and severe wind associated with hurricanes and tropical storms, is dramatically increased by low-quality or precarious buildings, particularly when they are
        concentrated in one area.These buildings are more likely to collapse or be damaged during storms, increasing the risk of flying debris, injury, and loss of life. </p>
      <h3>About 42% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered low-quality. </h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Buildings are considered low-quality if they lack some basic residential infrastructure, such as running water, electricity, or sewer. These factors can negatively impact residents' health, and can be worsened
        during severe weather events,
        making it more difficult to shelter in place.
        Low-quality buildings are often made with material such as plywood or metal sheets, which are highly vulnerable to winds and flooding. These buildings are commonly single-family homes concentrated in lower-income areas with unpaved roads
        and on the southwest side of Haulover Creek. </p>

      <h3> About 3% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered precarious.</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Precarious buildings lack all basic residential infrastructure. These structures are often built with waste materials and salvaged plywood and metal sheeting to support walls and roofing structures.
        These homes are very unstable and are normally elevated from ground level by pillars.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#01283c">Informal settlements</h2>
        <p>Precarious buildings are commonly found in informal settlement areas—unplanned areas where property rights are unestablished, or land is illegally occupied. Homes in these areas are usually poorly constructed by owners through whatever
          resources they can find. This type of home construction is not suitable for safely weathering natural disasters or flooding.</p>

        <p>In Belize City, informal settlements can be found in water catchment areas. These areas are low points of the floodplain where surface water runoff pools and, as such, are particularly vulnerable to flooding and storm surge.

        </p>
        <p>Krooman Lagoon and Gungulung, two of Belize City's informal settlement areas, are located on ecologically sensitive, flood-prone land. While some residents of these settlements are knowingly squatting, others were given informal
          arrangements to access the land. Homes constructed on publicly owned land (such as Krooman Lagoon) are considered illegal.
          As such, these residents face a constant displacement threat.</p>

        <p>These communities also have no access or unregulated access to electricity. Residents often run a network of informal electrical wires from existing utility lines. These wires are easily blown down during storms, which presents a very
          real danger of electric shock, as live wires may fall into standing water or onto walkways.</p>

        <p>Additionally, informal settlements are not served by sanitation services, and residents often use latrines or toss bagged waste into outside areas. Waste can contaminate the standing water in the communities, which exposes
          residents to dangerous bacteria and diseases, including E. coli, shigellosis, typhoid fever, salmonella, and cholera. Children are especially at risk for adverse health effects if they walk through or play in water that has been
          contaminated.</p>

        <p>As this November 2020 report from Belize City's News Channel 5 shows, residents of Krooman Lagoon and other flood-prone areas have made many attempts to adapt to the flooding they experience, but greater intervention is needed to protect

          <p style="text-align:justify">Mangrove wetlands are one of Belize City's most prized natural resources. The mangroves are a vital part of the ecosystem and are home to many plant and fish species. Mangroves also serve as storm protection:
            they are
            buffers against wind and waves, and natural flood basins, absorbing water and reducing pressure on stormwater infrastructure. Mangrove forests also protect inland communities and freshwater resources from
            saltwater intrusion.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">However, development in ecologically sensitive areas is reducing Belize City's mangrove wetlands. From 1980 to 2010, Belize City and the nearby cayes <a

        <h2>Sprawl and unplanned development</h2>
        <p>Commuter towns and suburbs to the north and west of Belize City are rapidly gaining population, as Belize City itself is losing population. In 1970, Belize City was home to 78% of the Belize District population, but by 2010, it held only
          60
          percent of the district's population. Much of this is related to expense: suitable land within Belize City is scarce, driving up the price. Additionally, low-rise and single-family
          housing is most common, which limits density and the number of units on the market. </p>

        <p>People who can't afford to live in the city, yet must commute in for work, are increasingly moving to towns along the north and west highways including Ladyville, Hattieville, Burrell Boom, 8 Miles, and Los Lagos. However, this development
          is proceeding with little consideration of the long-term impact. As they
          grow, these commuter towns are sprawling into extremely flood-prone land, including mangrove wetlands.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there is no efficient mass transit to connect the commuter towns and Belize City. As a result, these commuters must travel by car, and the spike in car congestion is creating chaotic traffic, and regular bottlenecks on the
          highways, particularly at the Haulover Creek crossings. In the event of severe storms, this presents an additional danger as the heavily used and flood-prone highways also serve as critical evacuation routes.</p>

        <h2>Loss of vibrancy</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The growth of the suburbs is also related to the decline of the center city. Belize City used to be the capital of Belize and also the center of economic, political, and cultural development. However, due to
          severe hurricanes, the capital was moved to Belmopan in 1970. Following the removal of the administration function, the downtown area of Belize City gradually suffered from economic stagnation and urban depression. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">A lack of economic planning in the 1980s further contributed to the decline. Without a variety of businesses in the downtown area, most shops were closed by evening. Downtown became a dead zone that was poorly
          maintained and poorly lit, which attracted nefarious activity. The area soon became associated with Belize City’s high homicide rate. Domestic gangs active in drug trafficking and robberies frequent the area. As the country’s role in the
          international drug trade has grown, Central American gangs and Mexican drug trafficking groups have also established a presence. Many once prosperous neighborhoods have become dangerous even for local citizens.</p>

        <h3>For the past few decades, Belize City's historic downtown has been less enjoyable for residents and visitors.</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Given these factors, the downtown area attracts very little tourism. As many tourists come to Belize for its lovely natural amenities and beautiful offshore islands, they are not overly interested in staying in
          Belize City. Although most flights and cruise ships regularly arrive in Belize City, most tourists immediately depart for other destinations.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Additionally, although many historic buildings remain, downtown also shows signs of blight, and some culturally significant buildings have had to be demolished due to disrepair or damage from natural disasters.
          Public spaces and parks are also used less frequently and their maintenance is neglected. As a result, residents may feel these areas are unsafe.</p>

As shown on the map, many areas frequented by gangs surround downtown Belize City. This creates major incentives for tourists to avoid visiting Belize City.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">While some efforts, including the Downtown Rejuvenation Program of Belize City, are trying to create a better tourism environment, effectively addressing the problem will also require an examination of the underlying issues that drive young people to join gangs, including <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/belize-city-community-gang-assessment" target="_blank"><B>poverty and a lack of economic

          <p style="text-align:justify">National and local building codes in Belize differ across scales and are also not well-enforced. Further, the existing codes are not designed with best practices for climate change and natural disasters in
            mind, including considerations for the impacts of storm surge, erosion, and flooding.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">An update to Belize City's current building standards, as well as improved enforcement is critical. New building codes should consider climate resilient elements such as elevation of living areas and utilities,
            and more specific material requirements for construction and foundations, which will protect residents and property from flood waters and other natural hazards. Additionally, <a
              href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/102a/f268ae84059a4421c73fb00b921020fd68d6.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:#d9785d;">coastal setbacks</a> can be used to establish a protective area between housing and the water's edge (or
            sensitive ecological areas, such as mangrove wetlands) to help address coastal erosion. Different standards could be created for
            existing structures to establish a baseline for safety, with more stringent standards applied to new construction.</p>
          <p><img src="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/setbacks.png" style="max-width:90%;"></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Improved enforcement of building codes can also help with the upkeep of properities and the monitoring of vaccancies, which could contribute to improved public safety and crime reduction. However, it is
            important
            that any heightened enforcement be paired with educational campaigns and resources to help property owners navigate requirements. These campaigns should be inclusive to residents in low-quality housing, which often includes women-led
            households,
            migrants, and other minority groups.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Improved building codes can also be developed in coordination with land use maps that can restrict new construction in areas of heightened flood vulnerability. </p>

          <h3 style="color:#ee8f9a;font-size:1.8em;line-height:3.9vh;">Addressing congestion and mobility</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify">The congestion along the northern and western highways suggests
            these routes provide sufficient demand for transit lines to connect the commuter towns with the city core. However, comprehensive transit planning is needed to prioritize buses and incentivize commuters not to drive.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Bus and transit reform is also needed within Belize City proper, as routes and schedules are inconsistant. Elderly riders and riders with disability may experienced gaps in service as they are not given proper
            time to board the bus or drivers simply do not stop for them.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:.7em;line-height:1.3em;"><img src="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/terminal.png" style="max-width:96%;"><br><i>
              The bus terminal at W Collect Canal as pictured in 2014 (Photos by Jasmine Halki, used under Flickr Creative Commons License).</i></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Standardizing bus routes, stops, and schedules across private companies would make the system more attractive to residents and visitors. It is especially critical to improve stops and schedules so seniors and
            riders with disabilities have
            more equitable access to the buses. A centralized fare collection system, such as a refillable transit card, would also make it easier for commuters to utilize the system. Incentivizing modernization of the buses, especially in regard to
            accesibility features, would also help
            make the buses more accessible for seniors and riders with diverse abilities. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Additionally, Belize City needs to prioritize adding bike lanes
            and improved pedestrian walkways. To start, the city can emphasize the creation of multimodal corridors throughout the downtown area by adding bike and walking paths that connect to water taxi stations and the bus terminal at West Collect
            Canal.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:.7em;line-height:1.3em;"><img src="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/bikes.png" style="max-width:96%;"><br><i>
              Adding dedicated bike lanes can help to safely separate bike riders and cars. Many streets in Belize City also need sidewalks to separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic. (Left photo from Inter-American Development Bank, right photo
              by Steve Monty. Both used under Flickr Creative Commons License).</i></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Improving mass transit and bike and pedestrian pathways has the added benefit of reducing the number of cars on the roads, which will lower Belize's greenhouse gas emissions. Though Belize contributes less
            than 0.01 percent of the total global emissions, these actions would still help support international mitigation efforts and show Belize to be a leader in climate change planning.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> However, comprehensive transit reform will require extensive coordination and cooperation, not only among the Belize City Council, Ministry of Transport, and the private sector, but also between the Belize
            City Council and the governments
            of the suburban commuter towns. The creation of formal bodies, such as a metropolitan planning commission, can help spearhead these efforts, and work to develop critical guidance, such as a regional master plan.</p>

          <h3 style="color:#ee8f9a;font-size:1.8em;line-height:3.9vh;">Protecting vulnerable populations & natural areas</h3>

          <div style="float: right; clear: right;padding-left:3.5vh;padding-bottom:2vh;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oQAsVG_DabI" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" float="right"></iframe>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
            Because Belize City's informal settlements are located in ecologically sensitive areas, these developments threaten the city's broader climate resilience and are unsafe for residents. This is especially true for Krooman Lagoon.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City Council is making efforts to secure land, move the residents of Krooman Lagoon, and restore the mangroves. However, any plan for Krooman Lagoon or other informal settlements must involve a
            consideration of the
            underlying issues of poverty and socioeconomic vulnerability that drove these populations to live in such risky areas in the first place. </p>


          <p style="text-align:justify"> Many residents of informal settlements have jobs that
            are intrinsically tied to the city. They also need to be able to access services in the city, including health care and schools. Moving them could disrupt economic and social networks, and be harmful, if not done carefully. This is
            especially
            critical for women and children.</p>

          <p style="text-align:justify">Around the world, people living in informal settlements are also often
            invisibilized by their government. Commitment to social justice means that it is important
            that any plans for relocation be done transparently, and with the involvement and support of the affected community. Additionally, while City Council works to secure new land, the community's other pressing needs must not go unaddressed.
          </p>
          <div class="video-container2"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FNews5Live%2Fvideos%2F2978090678957841%2F" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><span
            style="text-align:justify;font-size:.7em;line-height:1.3em;display:inline-block;"><i>As this video shows, the walkways of Krooman Lagoon are very vulnerable to flooding.
              One way the city can provide immediate assistance to these residents is by rebuilding these walkways so they are elevated and protected from water.</i></span>

          <p style="text-align:justify">Creating a formal plan for the future of Krooman Lagoon, in partnership with residents, presents one path forward. The plan should involve a phased timeline so the community knows when relocation would happen.
            Additionally, the plan should create a transition team of planning and health care
            professionals to address the community's essential needs both now and after the relocation. This should include preventive care and health screenings, especially for children; job training and employment placement
            assistance; and basic flood defenses while the community remains in the lagoon, including
            regular maintenance of the elevated walkways and materials to fortify homes from water. Many elements of this program could be offered to other informal settlement communities as well. </p>


          <p style="text-align:justify">It is also important to note that commuter towns such as Ladyville are also pushing into ecologically sensitive areas, including mangrove forests. Broader protection of the mangrove areas is another reason why
            comprehensive regional planning for
            the Belize City
            metropolitan region is critically needed.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#ee8f9a;line-height:1.05em;font-size:3.9vh;">Revitalizing downtown</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City has just completed the <a href="https://tourism.gov.bz/hoc-project/" target="_blank" style="color:#d9785d;">The Belize City House of Culture and Downtown Rejuvenation
           Project (BCHCDRP)</a>, a joint project of the Government of Belize and the Taiwan International Development Fund. The project’s goal was to preserve and revitalize historic colonial-style architecture, and introduce amenities to the downtown area, including botanical gardens and boardwalks.</p>
 <p style="text-align:justify">The BCHCDRP created an "EcoMuseum Zone" to guide visitors through historic sites in downtown Belize City. Visitors can download the “Belize City EcoMuseum App” on their mobile devices to get directions to sites of interest. Some important historical attractions that have been preserved and revitalized include the colonial Supreme Court, St. John’s Cathedral, and Belize Heritage Plaza.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify"><img src="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/Downtown.png" style="max-width:96%;"><br><span style="font-size:.6em;"><i>(From left) Supreme Court of Belize, St. John’s Cathedral,
              and The Anglican Cathedral College Urban Garden. (Images courtesy BCHCDRP.)</i></p>
              <p style="text-align:justify">With the EcoMuseum Zone completed, it is important that Belize City Council continue to build on the work of BCHCDRP by introducing efforts to keep downtown safe and lively throughout the day. Now that the area has improved attractions and signage for tourists, the next step should be incentivizing a variety of local businesses to operate downtown, especially in the evening and at night. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Urban planning can further support these efforts. One approach is to add walking and biking paths, green amenities and vegetation, and murals or public art that celebrate Belizean culture. Installing more street lights could also be a simple first step for  improving circulation and public safety, potentially reducing the occurrence of crime. These measures will also help bring more business to local shops and restaurants. More public space, including passive green space as well as interactive play spaces for children, would also improve the downtown for both local residents and visitors.</p>

          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:.8em;line-height:1.25em;">The first Wesley Church was built in 1829, but was destroyed by fire in 1863. A second church on the same site was again destroyed by hurricane in 1931. The current structure,
            built in 1951, is designated as a "memory site" to honor
            the architectural and cultural histor of Belize City. It is also an important reminder of the need for climate resilience.
