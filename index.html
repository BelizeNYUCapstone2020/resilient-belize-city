          <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City lies entirely at or below sea level, making it vulnerable to storm surge and rising sea levels associated with climate change. The city is expected to see damaging and life-threatening urban floods

          <p style="text-align:justify">Most of Belize City is in the 100-year floodplain, meaning there is at least a 1% chance
            that nearly all of the city could be inundated during an extreme hydrological event. However, climate change is making 100-year-floods more common, and there is evidence that "100-year storms" could happen <B><a

          <p style="text-align:justify">Without intervention, flooding in Belize City will become increasingly destructive and severe. However, flooding itself is only one aspect of climate change vulnerability. Because the health and prosperity of

          <p> In the next sections of this map, we will identify areas of vulnerability associated with climate change, and explain how planning interventions can help to protect people and property, build resilience, improve quality of life in

            Freetown Road, Belama, and Bellavista), and in the river basin and lagoons that are part of the natural and man-made drainage system. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">However, in more extreme events, such as seen in the 100-years return, storm surge will easily move beyond
            low-lying and coastal areas to overwhelm the inner areas of the city.</p>

      <h2 style="color:#01283c">Sub-standard buildings</h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Vulnerability to climate change, as well as the flooding and severe wind associated with hurricanes and tropical storms, is dramatically increased by low-quality or precarious buildings, particularly when they are
        concentrated in one area.
        These
        buildings are more likely to collapse or be damaged during storms, increasing the risk of flying debris, injury, and loss of life. </p>
      <h3>About 42% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered low-quality. </h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Buildings are considered low-quality if they lack some basic residential infrastructure, such as running water, electricity, or sewer. These factors can negatively impact residents' health, and can be worsened
        during severe weather events,
        making it more difficult to shelter in place.
        Low-quality buildings are often made with material such as plywood or metal sheets, which are highly vulnerable to winds and flooding. These buildings are commonly single-family homes concentrated in lower-income areas with unpaved roads
        and on the southwest side of Haulover Creek. </p>

      <h3> About 3% of Belize City residents live in housing stock that is considered precarious.</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Precarious buildings lack all basic residential infrastructure, and are often built with waste materials and some plywood and metal sheeting to support walls and roofing structures.
        These homes are very unstable and are normally elevated from ground level by pillars.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#01283c">Informal settlements</h2>
        <p>Precarious buildings are commonly found in informal settlement areasâ€”unplanned areas where property rights are unestablished or land is illegally occupied. Homes in these areas are usually poorly constructed by owners through whatever
          resources they can find. This type of home construction is not suitable against natural disasters, and is not sustainable in the long-term.</p>

        <p>Belize City's informal settlement areas are located in water catchment areas, which collect surface water runoff, making them particularly vulnerable to flooding and storm surge, and presenting development and climate resilience
          challenges.

        </p>
        <p>Krooman Lagoon and Gungulung, Belize City's two informal settlement areas, are on publicly owned land. While some residents are knowingly squatting, others were sold land titles, though these titles were not approved by the state.
          Therefore, these properties can be seized at any time, which would displace a large number of Belizians.</p>

        <p>These communities also have inadequate or no access to electricity, water, and sanitation, making informal settlement residents one of the most vulnerable groups in Belize. One of the most common illnesses related to unsafe water is
          diarrhea. Diarrhea, and the resulting dehydration, is the second leading cause of death among children under the age of 5 worldwide, and <b><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/diarrhea-burden.html" target="_blank">88% of
              diarrhea associated deaths around the world</a></b> are due to unsafe water and sanitation.

          <h2 style>Environmental degradation</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Mangorve wetlands are one of Belize City's most prized natural resources. The mangroves are a vital part of the ecosystem, and are home to many plant and fish species. Mangroves also serve as storm protection:
            they are
            buffers against wind and waves, and natural flood basins, absorbing water and reducing pressure on stormwater infrastructure. Mangrove forests also protect inland communities and freshwater resources from
            saltwater intrusion.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">However, development in ecologically sensitive areas is reducing Belize City's mangrove wetlands. From 1980 to 2010, Belize City and the nearby cayes <a

        <h2>Sprawl and unplanned development</h2>
        <p>Commuter towns and suburbs to the north and west of Belize City are rapidly gaining population, as Belize City itself is losing population. In 1970, Belize City was home to 78% of the Belize District population, but by 2010, it held only
          60
          percent of the district's population. Much of this is related to expense: suitable land within Belize City is scarce, driving up the price. Additionally, low-rise and single-family
          housing is most common, which limits density and the number of units on the market. </p>

        <p>People who can't afford to live in the city, yet must commute in for work, are increasingly moving to towns along the north and west highways including Ladyville, Hattieville, Burrell Boom, 8 Miles, and Los Lagos. However, this development
          is proceeding with little consideration of the long-term impact. As they
          grow, these commuter towns are sprawling into extremely flood-prone land, including mangrove wetlands.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there is no efficient mass transit to connect the commuter towns and Belize City. As a result, these commuters must travel by car, and the spike in car congestion is creating chaotic traffic, and regular bottlenecks on the
          highways, particularly at the Haulover Creek crossings. In the event of severe storms, this presents an additional danger as the heavily used and flood-prone highways also serve as critical evacuation routes.</p>

          annual growth rate is around 7%, this trend is expected to continue.</h3>
        <p>Ladyville experiences severe flooding and drainage issues. The area is in a natural drainage basin filled with marshlands and mangrove forests, making it highly susceptible to flooding from heavy rains. Due to its location on the banks of
          the Belize River and close proximity to the Caribbean Sea, this suburb is also highly vulnerable to storm surge. </p>

        <h2>Loss of vibrancy</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The growth of commuter towns and suburbs is related to the decline of the center city. Belize City used to be the capital city of Belize and also the hub of economic, political, and cultural development. However,
          due to severe hurricanes, the Government of Belize moved the capital to Belmopan in
          1970. Following the
          removal of the administration function, the downtown area of Belize City gradually suffered from economic stagnation and urban depression. </p>

        <h3>For the past few decades, Belize City's historic downtown has been less enjoyable for residents and visitors.</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Though once lively and vibrant, the historic downtown now has hardly any nightlife, fewer residents, and very little tourism. As many tourists come to Belize for its lovely natural amenities and beautiful
          offshore islands, they not overly interested in staying in Belize City. Although flights and cruise ships regularly bring visitors to Belize City, most tourists immediately depart for other destinations.</p>
        <p> Additionally, although many historic
          buildings remain, there are also signs of blight, and some historic and culturally significant buildings have had to be demolished due to disrepair. Public spaces and parks are also used less frequently and their maintainence is negelected.
          As a result,
          residents may feel these areas are unsafe. </p>

        <p>Belize has a remarkably high homicide rate, much of which is linked to gang violence. As shown on the map, domestic gangs are active in several areas in and around downtown Belize City. The prescence of gangs in the city has
          grown due to factors including the international drug trade, but also local issues, such as <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/en/belize-city-community-gang-assessment" target="_blank"><B>poverty and a lack of economic
              opportunity</B></a>.</p>

        <p>The violence brought by gangs presents a major challenge to the public safety and economy of Belize City. Violence compromises residentsâ€™ quality of life, exposes youth and children to trauma, and results in death or injury for hundreds of
          people annually, disincentivizing tourists to visit. These factors further contribute to the decline of the city center.</p>

          <h3 style="color:#ee8f9a;font-size:1.8em;line-height:1.05em;">Updating and enforcing local building standards</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify">National and local building codes in Belize differ across scales and are also not well-enforced. Further, the existing codes are not designed with best practices for climate change and natural disasters in
            mind, including considerations for the impacts of storm surge, erosion, and flooding.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">An update to Belize City's current building standards, as well as improved enforcement is critical. New building codes should consider climate resilient elements such as elevation of living areas and utilities,
            and more specific material requirements for construction and foundations, which will protect residents and property from flood waters and other natural hazards. Additionally, <a
              href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/102a/f268ae84059a4421c73fb00b921020fd68d6.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:#d9785d;">coastal setbacks</a> can be used to establish a protective area between housing and the water's edge (or
            sensitive ecological areas, such as mangrove wetlands) to help address coastal erosion. Different standards could be created for
            existing structures to establish a baseline for safety, with more stringent standards applied to new construction.</p>
          <p><img src="http://belizenyucapstone2020.github.io/resilient-belize-city/images/setbacks.png" style="max-width:90%;"></p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Improved enforcement of building codes can also help with the upkeep of properities and the monitoring of vaccancies, which could contribute to improved public safety and crime reduction. However, it is
            important
            that any heightened enforcement be paired with educational campaigns and resources to help property owners navigate requirements. These campaigns should be inclusive to residents in low-quality housing, which often includes women-led

          <h3 style="color:#ee8f9a;font-size:1.8em;line-height:3.9vh;">Addressing congestion and mobility</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify">The congestion along the northern and western highways suggests
            these routes provide sufficient demand for transit lines to connect the commuter towns with the city core. However, comprehensive transit planning is needed to prioritize buses and incentivize commuters not to drive.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Bus and transit reform is also needed within Belize City proper, as routes and schedules are inconsistant. Elderly riders and riders with disability may experienced gaps in service as they are not given proper
            time to board the bus or drivers simply do not stop for them.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Standardizing bus routes, stops, and schedules across private companies would make the system more attractive to residents and visitors. It is especially critical to improve stops and schedules so seniors and
            riders with disabilities have
            more equitable access to the buses. A centralized fare collection system, such as a refillable transit card, would also make it easier for commuters to utilize the system. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Additionally, Belize City needs to prioritize adding bike lanes
            and improved pedestrian walkways. To start, the city can emphasize the creation of multimodal corridors throughout the downtown area by adding bike and walking paths that connect to water taxi stations and the bus terminal at West Collect
            Canal.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Comprehensive transit reform will require extensive coordination and cooperation, not only among the Belize City government and the private sector, but also between the Belize City Council and the governments
            of the suburban commuter towns. The creation of formal bodies, such as a metropolitan planning commission, can help spearhead these efforts, and work to develop critical guidance, such as a regional master plan.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">Belize City is working hard on rejuvenating its downtown area. <a href="https://tourism.gov.bz/hoc-project/" target="_blank" style="color:#d9785d;">The Belize City House of Culture and Downtown Rejuvenation
            Project (BCHCDRP)</a>, a joint project of
          the Government of Belize and the Taiwan International Development Fund, is working to preserve and revitalize historic colonial-style architecture, and introduce amenities including botanical gardens and boardwalks.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The BCHCDRP has created an <a href="https://belizecityecomuseum.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#d9785d;">"EcoMuseum Zone"</a> to guide visitors through historic sites in downtown Belize City, as well as
          current project sites where
          revitalization is ongoing. Some important historical sites that are being preserved and revitalized include the colonial Supreme Court, St. Johnâ€™s Cathedral. and Belize Heritage Plaza.</p>

              and The Anglican Cathedral College Urban Garden.</i></p>
        <p>Planning can further support these efforts. One approach is to add wayfinding features, such as walking and biking paths, green amenities and vegetation, improved signage, and murals or public art that celebrate Belizean culture.
          These measures can help direct visitors to circulate through the area and visit local shops and restaurants. Cultural programming can also help ensure downtown stays lively in the evenings and at night.</p>

        <p>Urban communities in Belize are confronted with many challenges today. The issues we've explored in this map represent only a portion of the work that remains to be done. With thoughtful planning, Belize's urban areas can become
          international examples of climate change action, and home to inclusive, resilient, and thriving communities.</p>
        <h3 style="color:#ee8f9a">The COVID-19 pandemic presents additonal and far-ranging implications for Belize City, and the health and resilience of its residents.</h3>
        <p>The pandemic is exacerbating existing vulnerabilities, harming the local and national economy, and threatening public health. As Belize City continues to deal with the impacts of COVID-19, resilience and climate change awareness must be
          centered in the planning response and recovery.</p>
